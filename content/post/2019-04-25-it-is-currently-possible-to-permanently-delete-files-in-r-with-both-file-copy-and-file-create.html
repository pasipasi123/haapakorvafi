<p>After an incident at work that involved deleting an entire project I discovered a dangerous bug (or feature) in base R functions <code>file.copy()</code> and <code>file.create()</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s first create a directory and a file inside it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dir.create(&quot;foo&quot;)
cat(file = &quot;foo/bar&quot;, &quot;baz\n&quot;)
readLines(&quot;foo/bar&quot;)
#&gt; [1] &quot;baz&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We’ll then permanently delete the file contents.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>file.copy(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, recursive = TRUE)
#&gt; [1] TRUE
readLines(&quot;foo/bar&quot;)
#&gt; character(0)</code></pre>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>Looking at <code>file.copy()</code> code, we can see that <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are checked in an <code>if</code> statement <code>if (recursive &amp;&amp; to %in% from)</code>, but because <code>"foo"</code> is not <code>"."</code>, the statement is not triggered. If it had been, the function would have stopped <code>stop("attempt to copy a directory to itself")</code>.</p>
<p>It looks like (there’s a call to C code) <code>file.copy()</code> then goes on to read the files in <code>from</code> and <code>file.create()</code> them in <code>to</code> directory. <code>file.create()</code> has another interesting property: it doesn’t check if the file already exists. It goes on to create the file, which already exists, and removes all its contents.</p>
<div id="a-fix" class="section level2">
<h2>A fix</h2>
<p>Obviously, <code>from</code> needs to be checked if it’s the same as <code>to</code> and in the current if statement this is attempted. However it only checks if these two strings are exactly the same, but copying a directory to its own parent directory doesn’t trigger the condition. We need to check if <code>to</code> is in the parent directory of <code>from</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (recursive &amp;&amp; (to %in% from || 
      normalizePath(dirname(normalizePath(from))) == normalizePath(to)))</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>normalizePath()</code> is used because it, according to its help file, “Convert[s] file paths to canonical form for the platform, to display them in a user-understandable form and so that <em>relative and absolute paths can be compared.</em>” <code>dirname()</code> outputs different path form so both input and output of <code>dirname()</code> needs to put through <code>normalizePath()</code>.</p>
<p>Another option would be to see if <code>from %in% list.files(to)</code> but I think this could be slow if <code>to</code> is a large directory.</p>
<p>If we use the if statement with <code>normalizePath()</code> in an otherwise identical function called <code>file.copy2()</code>, we can’t copy the directory to itself.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>file.copy2(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, recursive = TRUE)
#&gt; Error in file.copy2(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, recursive = TRUE): attempt to copy a directory to itself</code></pre>
</div>
